## Usage statistics collection in Useful Browser

By default, Useful Browser does not send any usage statistics. Statistics collection is disabled.

If you fork this project and want to enable statistics collection, you can set up your own analytics endpoint and update the URL in `js/statistics.js`.

Useful Browser does not send:
* Anything that can be used to personally identify you
* Any browsing history, passwords, or other data stored locally in Useful Browser
